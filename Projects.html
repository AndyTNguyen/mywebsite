    <p id="pageinfo"> During my time as a student at Penn State, I had to participate in all sorts of IT projects. Some of my project experience required programming, web development, work with a database, work with User Interface/ User Experience, prototyping, and providing clients with an IT solution to their business problems. Down below I selected a couple of projects that best represent projects that I want to continue working with. </p>

                        The final project for my database management class is to create a database that includes over 10 tables. Each table had to connect with another with primary keys, foreign keys, etc. My project included over 200 fields, an ER diagram, and a bunch of queries that included select statement, update, delete, and joins. I decided to build a database that revolves around phones since many people have phones and it has become a standard to own for many. I had tables involving types of phone, customers, manufacturers, phone plans, service provider, etc. My database was done in SQL on notepad.</td>

                    <td valign="top"><h3> Penn State Defense </h3> 
                        For this project, I had to team up with two other students and led the team to develop a video game. As the team leader, my biggest challange is to get the members to communicate with each other. The game took most of the semester and was created by using Java and some XML. The game is based off of my idea of combining Pong and Brick Break. Each player has to get the ball into the opponent's score zone by first breaking through the layer of the opponent's brick. The game can be played with two players or a single player against an AI.

                        This is the first website my final project for my web development class and is the first website I developed and it was also available to the public.I created this website using mostly HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I created this website using a Harry Potter fan theme, since I could easily fit meet the project requirements. The website included features like being able to watch movie trailers, buy the book series, a poll for which house you would prefer to be in, and character information.</td>

                        The objective of this project is to create the most useful and most creative app prototype that promotes health or fitness. In a team that consist of 3 members, we had to compete against 15 other teams. Through Interview and surveys on lifters, we were able to brainstorm keyfeatures for our prototype. We then developed the prototype using JustInMind and performed testings. With the test results we recieved feedbacks from our user group and adjust the prototype. We presented our project and came in th   ird place.

                        <br>
                        <p> Based on the teams persona and scenario, our prototype app functions like a fitness coach. Users will progress and achieve new fitness goals thanks to the app provision of workout routines, motivation, and entertainment. The app heavily relies on having strong community that supports where users would support one another and providing  advices so that users will continue to use the app</p>

                        In this project, I led three other members to come up with a solution to a client's business problem. For this project, the professor wanted us to find a client in the real world by ourselves and provide them a solution to their business problem. A team member has connections with JP Morgan Chase Bank, which became our client. The representative from JPM gave our team a business problem, regarding the long wait time for customers to talk to a banking representative. The team decided to create a prototype function that allows users to schedule an appointment using the Chase Mobile app. I developed the prototype by using JustInMind. The plan is to have my team handed off the prototype and the deliverable to the JPM team. The JPM team will then pitch their idea to the app developers in hopes of having the function implemented into the Chase Mobile app.  </td>

                        For this group project, the team has to come up with ways to further progress communication for George's floral business. While other members of the group were focusing on improving social media platform and ads, I focused on George's website. I analyzed their current website to determine how I could further enhance the website to appeal more to potential customers. Some of the changes that I came up with includes enlarging the logo, changing the color scheme, adding an image for the background, provide consistency for the company's social media links, made flower arrangement easier to read, adding size option next to the price, and changing the background. </td>

                        The goal is to create a wireframe app that our user group, Penn State alumni, would use. Since the project revolves around user-centered design, we interviewed different age groups of Penn State alumni. The interview helped us determine the two most important functions and features for the wireframe. In the end, we wanted the app to be able to connect Alumni with each other and to provide Penn State score updates. We each created personas and scenarios. Soon after, I created the wireframe using Marvelapp. Once the prototype is finished, the team went into the testing phase. With the feedback from the alumni user group, we were able to determine what we can improve in our wireframe. The last part of the project is to implement changes to Marvalapp base on the user feedback

Please note that most of the feature and function will lead to an error, since features are not apart of the scenario.

						Developing websites, learning new web technologies, and improving my skill is my current main of focus. I've started these projects since Early October and have been constantly working on these projects. Some of the languages that I've been working on includes HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap, AngularJS, Jquery, JavaScript. The main idea of of this project is to also provide viewers that I can create interactive and responsive websites using those listed languages. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<p> Please note that my eportfolio isn't as responsive compared to these projects. My eportfolio was created months before I started this project. Back then, my skills in creating responsive websites and technology skills were not on par compared to now. I will entually update the rest of my eportfolio once I've completed more websites for this project </p>
